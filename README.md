# scodex

[English](./README.md) | [简体中文](./README.zh-CN.md)

`scodex` selects the Codex account with the best immediately usable quota, switches `~/.codex/auth.json`, and then launches or resumes Codex.

The repository is intentionally code-only. It does not contain account pool data, cached usage, local config, or virtualenv files.

This repository is now Rust-only. `scodex` is the maintained implementation and the only supported runtime in the source tree.

If you do not like or are not used to the command line, try the more feature-rich GUI version: <https://github.com/murongg/ai-accounts-hub>

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lauzhihao/scodex/main/install.sh | bash
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lauzhihao/scodex/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

Current prebuilt release targets:

- Linux: `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`
- macOS: `x86_64-apple-darwin`, `aarch64-apple-darwin`
- Windows: `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`

The installer:

- downloads a prebuilt Rust release binary from GitHub Releases
- installs `scodex` as the primary command
- keeps `auto-codex` as a compatibility command
- installs `scodex-original` as a thin passthrough helper to the underlying `codex`
- imports `~/.codex/auth.json` into local state when it exists
- refreshes usage cache after import when the usage API is reachable

## Requirements

- Unix installer: `bash`, `curl`, `tar`
- Windows installer: PowerShell 5+ or PowerShell 7+
- `codex` is still required at runtime for `launch`, `login`, and passthrough commands
- when `codex` is missing, `scodex` prompts to install the official CLI with `npm install -g @openai/codex`
- `deploy` additionally requires `ssh` and `scp`
- `push` and `pull` additionally require `git` plus `SCODEX_POOL_KEY`

Build from source:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Entrypoints

- `scodex`: primary command
- `auto-codex`: legacy compatibility wrapper
- `scodex-original`: passthrough helper to the underlying Codex CLI binary
- `codex`: the official Codex CLI command, left unchanged

## Command Overview

Use `scodex` as the default command. The legacy `auto-codex` wrapper is kept only for backward compatibility.

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `scodex` | Refresh usage, keep the current account when its 5h quota is at least 20%, otherwise switch to the best account, then launch or resume Codex |
| `scodex launch` | Explicit form of the default behavior |
| `scodex auto` | Refresh usage, keep the current account when its 5h quota is at least 20%, otherwise switch to the best account, without launching Codex |
| `scodex add` | Open the OpenAI signup page when possible, then add one account through device auth |
| `scodex login` | Add one account via `codex login --device-auth` |
| `scodex deploy <target>` | Copy the current `~/.codex/auth.json` to a remote machine and path (`sync` is an alias) |
| `scodex push <repo>` | Push the local account pool into a Git repository subdirectory |
| `scodex pull <repo>` | Pull an account pool from a Git repository subdirectory into the local state directory |
| `scodex use <email>` | Switch directly to a known account by email |
| `scodex list` | Refresh live usage, then show the latest account quotas |
| `scodex refresh` | Refresh live usage for all known accounts and print the latest results |
| `scodex import-auth <path>` | Import an `auth.json` file or a home directory containing `auth.json` |
| `scodex import-known` | Import `~/.codex/auth.json`; optionally import AI Accounts Hub managed homes |
| `scodex update` | Download the latest matching Rust release asset from GitHub Releases and replace the installed binary (`upgrade` is an alias) |

## Supported Options

### Global Options

- `--state-dir <path>`: override the local state directory
- `-h`, `--help`: show help

### `launch`

```bash
scodex launch [--no-import-known] [--no-login] [--dry-run] [--no-resume] [--no-launch] [<codex args...>]
```

- `--no-import-known`: skip auto-import of `~/.codex/auth.json`
- `--no-login`: do not start device auth when no usable account exists
- `--dry-run`: print which account would be selected without switching or launching
- `--no-resume`: always start a fresh Codex session instead of `resume --last`
- `--no-launch`: switch the account but do not start Codex
- extra args after the command are forwarded to Codex
- after refresh, if the current account still has at least 20% remaining in the 5h window, `launch` keeps using it instead of re-scoring all accounts

### `auto`

```bash
scodex auto [--no-import-known] [--no-login] [--dry-run]
```

- refreshes usage and keeps the current account when its 5h quota is at least 20%; otherwise it switches to the best account
- does not start Codex

### `login`

```bash
scodex login [--oauth --username <EMAIL> --password <PASS>]
```

- login always switches to the newly added account
- `--oauth`: use the browser OAuth flow and auto-fill the provided credentials in a controlled Chrome window
- `--username <EMAIL>` / `--password <PASS>`: required together with `--oauth`

### `add`

```bash
scodex add [--switch]
```

- tries to open `https://auth.openai.com/create-account` in the default browser
- if no GUI is available, prints the signup URL and continues in guided mode
- after signup or login, continues with `codex login --device-auth`
- `--switch`: switch to the newly added account after signup/login

### `use`

```bash
scodex use <email>
```

- switches directly to the known account whose email matches `<email>` case-insensitively
- example: `scodex use lauzhihao@qq.com`

### `deploy`

```bash
scodex deploy [-i <identity_file>] <user@host:/target_path>
scodex sync [-i <identity_file>] <user@host:/target_path>
```

- copies the current live `~/.codex/auth.json` to the remote machine
- `deploy` is the primary name; `sync` is a compatible alias for users who think in multi-machine sync flows
- if `<target_path>` ends with `auth.json`, it is treated as the exact remote file path
- otherwise `<target_path>` is treated as a remote directory and `auth.json` is written under it
- `-i <identity_file>`: pass an SSH identity file to both `ssh` and `scp`
- the command prepares the remote directory and then copies the credential file
- authentication is left to your existing SSH setup; if `ssh` or `scp` asks for a password, enter it yourself

### `push`

```bash
export SCODEX_POOL_KEY='replace-with-a-long-random-secret'
scodex push [-i <identity_file>] [--path <repo_path>] <repo>
```

- clones `<repo>` with your existing Git credentials
- requires `SCODEX_POOL_KEY` in the environment and derives a symmetric encryption key from it
- exports the local account pool into `.scodex-account-pool/bundle.enc.json` by default
- the repository only stores the encrypted bundle; account auth files are not committed in plaintext
- always pushes the current local snapshot as the source of truth; it does not merge remote account-pool history
- commits and pushes only when the exported bundle changed
- `--path <repo_path>`: use a different repository subdirectory; it must stay relative and must not contain `..`
- `-i <identity_file>`: pass an SSH private key to git via `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` for SSH-based remotes
- if `git` is missing, `scodex` prints an install hint instead of trying to install it for you
- if the repository is private and access fails, `scodex` tells you to check the repo URL plus your Git credentials, SSH key, or PAT

### `pull`

```bash
export SCODEX_POOL_KEY='replace-with-the-same-secret'
scodex pull [-i <identity_file>] [--path <repo_path>] <repo>
```

- clones `<repo>` with your existing Git credentials
- requires the same `SCODEX_POOL_KEY` used during `push`
- reads the encrypted account pool from `.scodex-account-pool/bundle.enc.json` by default
- force-overwrites the local account pool with the remote snapshot instead of merging
- clears old local account homes and resets local usage cache before writing the pulled snapshot
- if the key is wrong, `pull` fails with a decryption error instead of importing partial data
- `--path <repo_path>`: read from a different repository subdirectory; it must stay relative and must not contain `..`
- `-i <identity_file>`: pass an SSH private key to git via `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` for SSH-based remotes

### `list`

```bash
scodex list
```

- refreshes live usage first, then prints the latest account quota snapshot

### `refresh`

```bash
scodex refresh
```

- calls the live usage API for all known accounts
- prints the refreshed account list immediately after the API calls finish
- the current Rust release refreshes usage in parallel

### `import-auth`

```bash
scodex import-auth <path>
```

- `<path>` can be an `auth.json` file or a parent directory containing `auth.json`

### `import-known`

```bash
scodex import-known
```

- imports `~/.codex/auth.json`
- to also import AI Accounts Hub managed Codex homes, set:

```bash
AUTO_CODEX_IMPORT_ACCOUNTS_HUB=1 scodex import-known
```

### `update`

```bash
scodex update [-f|--force]
scodex upgrade [-f|--force]
```

- downloads the latest matching GitHub Releases asset for the current platform and replaces the installed binary
- `update` remains the primary command for compatibility with earlier scodex releases
- `upgrade` is a compatible alias for users who prefer that wording
- `-f`, `--force`: force reinstall even when the current version already matches the latest release tag

## Passthrough Behavior

If the first non-global argument is not one of the documented subcommands, `scodex` treats it as a Codex CLI command after account selection.

Examples:

```bash
scodex resume --last
scodex exec "fix failing test"
```

This is why `scodex resume --last` works even though `resume` is not a declared `scodex` subcommand.

## Selection Notes

- usage refresh runs against the live usage API, not only the local cache
- account selection prefers higher `5h` remaining quota before weekly quota
- the goal is to choose the account most likely to be immediately usable for the next session

## Publish Checklist

Before pushing:

1. Run `rg -n 'access_token|refresh_token|id_token|OPENAI_API_KEY|account_id|@qq\\.com|/Users/ncds|/Users/liuzhihao' .`
2. Confirm `git status --short` only shows code and docs.
3. Review `git diff --cached` before pushing.

## Release Notes

- CI now targets the Rust implementation only.
- Tagged releases `v*` publish prebuilt binaries through GitHub Actions.
- The historical Python implementation has been removed from this repository.
